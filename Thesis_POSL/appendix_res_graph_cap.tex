\chapter{Results of experiments with \carrp}
\label{app:cap}
\textit{This Appendix, presents graphically a summary of individuals runs using \carrp. Figures show a \textit{box-plot} representation for different strategies and a bar representation for the percentage of winner solvers types.}

\newpage

In Figure~\ref{boxplot:comm} labels of the x-axis correspond to the following strategies:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-1mm]
\item \textbf{NC}: Non communication strategy, 
\item \textbf{A1-1}: 100\% of communicating solvers performing the \commstr{} A \oneTone, 
\item \textbf{B1-1}: 100\% of communicating solvers performing the \commstr{} B \oneTone,
\item \textbf{A1-n}: 100\% of communicating solvers performing the \commstr{} A \oneTn,
\item \textbf{B1-n}: 100\% of communicating solvers performing the \commstr{} B \oneTn,
\item \textbf{50A1-1}: 50\% of communicating solvers performing the \commstr{} A \oneTone, 
\item \textbf{50B1-1}: 50\% of communicating solvers performing the \commstr{} B \oneTone,
\item \textbf{50A1-n}: 50\% of communicating solvers performing the \commstr{} A \oneTn,
\item \textbf{50B1-n}: 50\% of communicating solvers performing the \commstr{} B \oneTn,
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{barplot:19} represents the percentage of winner solvers for each communication strategy, according to four different types:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-1mm]
\item \receiver{Receiver}: Receiver solver wining thanks to the received information, 
\item \sender{Sender}: Sender solver, 
%\item \nonreceiver{Pasive receiver}: Receiver solver wining without using the received information,
\item \textbf{Non communicating}: Non communicating solver.
\end{enumerate}
