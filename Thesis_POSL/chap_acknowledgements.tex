\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\vspace*{1cm}
It is a pleasure for me to express my gratitude to the many people who have helped me or have been an important part of my life the last three and a half years.

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to two persons: To my thesis director Mr. Éric {\sc Monfroy} for his guidance and exigency. His wisdom and charisma inspired me during the thesis. Also to Mr. Florian {\sc Richoux} for his wise and continuous mentoring and friendship. Much of what I learned during grad school was thanks to him. I feel sincerely lucky to have you both as advisors.

\modified{Besides, I would like to thank the rest of my thesis committee: Mr. Salvador {\sc Abreu} and Mr. Christophe {\sc Lecoutre} for agreeing to be reviewers; and Mr. Arnaud {\sc Lallouet} and Mr. Frédéric {\sc Lardeux} for the assistance and the fruitful discussions all these years.}

\modified{My sincere thanks also goes to the laboratory \emph{LINA}, \emph{Inria-TASC} the research group, and all members of the administration who made this project possible and my professional improvement. I thank my fellow lab mates for their continuous support and for making me feel at home. Thanks also to Mr. Alibeit {\sc Kakes Cruz}, Mr. Juan Manuel {\sc Otero Pereira}, Mr. Antoni {\sc Jaume-i-Capó} and Mr. Manuel {\sc González Hidalgo} for their kind references. }

Last but not least, I would like to thanks to my favorite secondary characters of this thesis, whom without knowing, have turned stressed and [...] days into happiness: my friends. To Geraldine, Emanuelle and Gema, for sharing many hours of passion for music and dance. To Yáhima and Lyan, for their unconditional and unlimited help, no matter the whether, \tet{sleep} or geographic location. And to my dear friend Yovany, una de las personas a la que más le debo en la vida, y porque sin su ayuda, ni siquiera hubiero podido comenzar esta tesis.

%To all of you, thank you very much.
