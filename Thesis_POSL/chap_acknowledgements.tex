\vspace*{1cm}
It is a pleasure for me to express my gratitude to the many people who have helped me or have been an important part of my life the last three and a half years.

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to two persons: To my thesis director Mr. Éric {\sc Monfroy} for his guidance and exigency. His wisdom and charisma inspired me during the thesis. Also to Mr. Florian {\sc Richoux} for his wise and continuous mentoring and friendship. Much of what I learned during grad school was thanks to him. I feel sincerely lucky to have you both as advisors.

Besides, I would like to thank the rest of my thesis committee: Mr. Salvador {\sc Abreu} and Mr. Christophe {\sc Lecoutre} for agreeing to be reviewers; and Mr. Arnaud {\sc Lallouet} and Mr. Frédéric {\sc Lardeux} for the assistance and the useful discussions all these years.

My sincere thanks also goes to the laboratory \emph{LINA}, \emph{Inria-TASC} the research group, and all members of the administration who made this project possible and my professional development. I thank my fellow lab mates for their continuous support and for making me feel at home. Thanks also to Mr. Alibeit {\sc Kakes Cruz}, Mr. Juan Manuel {\sc Otero Pereira}, Mr. Antoni {\sc Jaume-i-Capó} and Mr. Manuel {\sc González Hidalgo} for their recommendation letters.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my favorite supporting actors on this thesis, whom oblivious have turned hard and stressful days into happiness: my dear friends. To Emmanuelle, Gema and Geraldine, for sharing so many hours of music and dance. They helped through ups and especially downs. To Yahima and Lyan, for their unconditional and unlimited help, no matter the weather, the location or the sleeping patterns. To Melodi for her priceless help with the summary in French language. And to my dear friend Yovany, whom I owe the most. Without his help, I wouldn't have even be able to start this thesis.

%To all of you, thank you very much.
