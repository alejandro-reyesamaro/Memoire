\chapter{Experiments design and results}
\label{chap:expe}
\textit{In this chapter I expose all details about the process of evaluation of \posl{}, i.e., all experiments I perform. For each benchmark, I explain also used strategies in the evaluation process.
I explain the used environments were we run the experiments (description of my desktop machine, \textit{Curiosiphi} server). %, and eventually \textit{Grid5000}). 
I describe all the experiments and I expose a complete analysis of the obtained result.}

In this chapter I illustrate and analyze the versatility of \posl{} studying different ways to solve constraint problems based on local search meta-heuristics. 
I have chosen the \sgp, the \nqp, the \carrp{} and the \grp{} as benchmarks since they are two challenging yet differently structured problems. In this chapter I present formally each benchmark, I explain the structure of \posl's solvers that I generated for experiments and present a detailed analysis of obtained results.

The experiments\footnote{\posl{} source code is available on GitHub:\href{https://github.com/alejandro-reyesamaro/POSL}{https://github.com/alejandro-reyesamaro/POSL}} 
were performed on an Intel\R{} Xeon\TM{} E5-2680 v2, 10$\times$4 cores, 2.80GHz. Showed results are the means of 30 runs for each setup, presented in columns labeled {\bf T}, corresponding to the run-time in seconds, and {\bf It.} corresponding to the number of iterations; and their respective standard deviations ({\bf T(sd)} and {\bf It.(sd)}). In some tables, the column labeled \textbf{\% success} indicates the percentage of solvers finding a solution before reaching a time--out (5 minutes).

\modified{The experiments in this section are multi-walk runs using the same solver main structure (except differents w.r.t. communication operations). Parallel experiments use 40 cores for all problem instances.  It is important to point out that \posl{} is not designed to obtain the best results in terms of performance, but to give the possibility of rapidly prototyping and studying different cooperative or non cooperative search strategies.}

\modified{All benchmarks were coded using the \posl{} low-level framework in C++.}

\modified{First results using \posl{} to solve constraint problems were published in \cite{Reyes-amaro} were we used \posl{} to solve the \sgp{} and study some communication strategies. It was the first version of \posl{}, therefore it was able to solve only relatively easy instances. However, the efficacy of the communication was showed using this tool.}

\modified{With the next and more optimized version of \posl{}, I decide to start to perform more detailed studies using the benchmark mentioned before and some others.}
