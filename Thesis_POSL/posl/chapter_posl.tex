\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:posl_intro}

Meta-heuristic methods, despite showing very good results for solving \CSPs, are frequently not enough for solving instances with extremely large search spaces. Most of these methods are sensible to their large number of parameters. For that reason, a first direction for this thesis was to tackle one of the weakest points of meta-heuristic methods: theirs parameters. In Appendix~\ref{chap:prior_paramils} a performed study applying {\sc ParamILS} to {\it Adaptive Search} in order to find a general parameter settings was presented. This experiment did not produce encouraging results. That is why it was decided to abandon the idea as the main direction of the thesis, but not as future work.

From the beginning of the current investigation, the target problems were big and complex instances of \csps. For that reason, even if the current version of the framework does not provide auto tuning mechanisms, this thesis focuses on the implementation of a mechanism to easily build solvers based on local search meta-heuristic, providing an easy way of reusing algorithm's components commons to different methods.

With the development of parallelism, opening new ways to tackle constrained problems, the accessibility to this technology to a broad public has also increased. It is available through multi-core personal computers, Xeon Phi cards and GPU video cards. For that reason it was decided to focus this thesis completely on the parallel approach. In Appendix~\ref{chap:prior_split} it was presented a study in which the problem-subdivision approach was applied to the resolution of {\it K-Medoids Problem}. The main goal of this work was generalizing the proposed ideas to similar problems. It was only a theoretical study, performed in parallel with what would latter be the main scientific contribution of this thesis.

Many results from the literature indicate that the combination of meta-heuristic methods with parallelism provides very good results for large scale \csps. This investigation focuses in the implementation of the multi-walk parallel approach. Most of the methods found in the state of the art of this field are based on applying clever techniques to accelerate the solution process of specific problems. The present work does not apply partitioning techniques neither for the search space nor for the target problem. This make the proposed framework applicable in a general and more easy way for a broad range of problems.

Another weak point of the development process that is frequently undervalued is the codding time, which is always long when coding parallel programs. This was the main motivation to start searching techniques for implementing parallel solution strategies with or without communication in a fast and easy way. The main goal was creating a tool providing 
\begin{inparaenum}[1-]
%\item a simple way to create \textit{flexible} solvers, i.e. solvers ables to be modified with a few effort; 
\item fast and simple mechanisms to connect solvers, ables to exchange information; 
\item and a way to create numerous and different parallel strategies, where different communicating and not communicating solvers can be combined, exploiting to the maximum computation resources.
\end{inparaenum}

\subsection{Precedents}

During the development process, some inspired ideas were taken into account. {\sc Hyperion}$^2$ \cite{Brownlee2014} is a java framework for building meta-- and hyper--heuristics providing generic templates for a variety of local search and evolutionary computation algorithms, allowing quick prototyping with the possibility of reusing source code. This tool illustrate a bit one of the main goals of this thesis. Rapid and fast prototyping of algorithms through high-level languages is more and more imperative due to the increasing demand of algorithms to solve very complex algorithms coming from the development of the technology. Nevertheless, this solution does not take into account parallelism.

Alex~S.~Fukunaga propose in~\cite{Fukunaga2008} an evolutionary approach that uses a simple composition operator to automatically discover new local search heuristics for SAT and to visualize them as combinations of blocks. A similar idea is presented in~\cite{Landtsheer2015} by \etal{Landtsheer}, a framework to facilitate the development of local search methods by using \textit{combinators} to design features commonly found in these methods as standard bricks and joining them. Authors define four types of bricks: \begin{inparaenum}[1-] \item neighborhoods functions, \item strategies to scape from local minima, \item solution managers, allowing to store the best found solution during the search, and \item stop criteria.
\end{inparaenum} This approach can speed up the development and experimentation of search procedures when developing a specific solver based on local search. The goal of this thesis is to create a tool offering the same advantages, but providing also a mechanism to define communication protocols between solvers working in parallel. It must also provide a way to create an abstract solver by combining simple components or functions that called \ms.

{\it ParadisEO} is a framework presented by \etal{Cahon} in~\cite{Cahon2004} to design parallel and distributed hybrid meta-heuristics showing very good results, including a broad range of reusable features to easily design evolutionary algorithms and local search methods. \etal{Martin} propose in~\cite{Martin2016} an approach of using cooperating meta--heuristic based local search processes, using an asynchronous message passing protocol. The cooperation is based on the general strategies of pattern matching and reinforcement learning. 

%The main challenge faced in this thesis is finding the right communication strategy  

We can cite a lot of works to prove that high-level framework for the development of efficient algorithms, as well as the parallel approach with or without communication have been widely used reporting good results. However, a solution combining a modular way to construct algorithms with tools to manage the parallelism is still missing. It is well know that interprocess communication can help during the search process of constrained solvers, but it is also well know that this communication is very complicated to perform in practice, due to certain overheads. In that sense this thesis propose a framework to create parallel communication strategies, by providing tools to easily manipulate:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{where to perform the communication} $\rightarrow$ using operators to combine information reception modules with \cms{} inside the algorithm, 
\item \textbf{what to communicate} $\rightarrow$ configurations, neighborhoods, configuration costs, algorithms, etc., and
\item \textbf{how to perform the communication} $\rightarrow$ providing instructions to create and connect in different ways sets of solvers.
\end{enumerate}

%The tool developed for this thesis, uses this idea where search process features can be combined and reused, and it is also possible to design communication strategies between solvers.

\subsection{POSL}

In this chapter is presented \posl{}, the main contribution of this thesis, as well as the different steps to build communicating parallel solvers with. It is proposed as a new way to implement \textit{solution algorithms} to solve \CSPs, through local-search meta-heuristics using the multi-walk parallel approach. It is based on improving step by step an initial configuration, driven by a \textit{cost function} provided by the user through the model. The implementation must follow the following stages.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The conceived \textit{solution algorithm} to solve the target problem is decomposed into small modules of computation, which are implemented as separated {\it functions}. We name them \oms{} (see Figure~\ref{subfig:modules}, blue shapes). At this point it is crucial to find a good decomposition of its \textit{solution algorithm}, because it will have a significant impact in its future re-use. In this stage is also decided which information is interesting to \textit{receive} from other solvers. This information is encapsulated into another kind of component called \opch, allowing data transmission between solvers (see Figure~\ref{subfig:modules}, red shapes).
\item Solvers templates called \INTROass{} are created through \posl{}'s inner language only by using module signatures. 
\item \Ass{} are instantiated with concrete modules (\oms{} and \opchs). It allows good levels of code re-use: many different solvers can be created sharing the same template. %(the interested reader is referred to  Appendix~\tet{[...]}) 
\item The parallel-oriented language based on operators provided by \posl{} (see Figure~\ref{subfig:as}, green shapes) allows the information exchange, and executing modules in parallel. In this stage the information that is interesting to be shared with other solvers is sent using operators. After that we can connect them using {\it communication operators}. This final entity is called a \INTROsoset{} (see Figure~\ref{subfig:conn}).
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

%Once the solvers set is ready, the last step is to model the problem to solve. To do so, the user must follow the framework specification to implement the benchmark, respecting some requirements. The most important one is to implement a {\it cost function} computing the cost for a given configuration, i.e., an integer indicating how much the configuration violates the set of constraints. This integer equals zero if the configuration is a solution.

In the following sections all these steps are explained in details, but first, I explain how to model the target benchmark using \posl.

\section{Summarize}
\label{sec:posl_zum}

In this chapter \posl{} have been formally presented, as a Parallel--Oriented Solver Language to build meta-heuristic-based solver to solve \CSPs{}. This language provides a set of \oms{} useful to solve a wide range of constrained problems. It is also possible to create new ones, through the low-level framework in C++ programming language. \posl{} also provides a set of \opchs{}, essential features to share information between solvers.

One of the \posl's advantages is the possibility of creating, using an operator-based language, \ass{} remaining independent from concrete \bothmodules{}. It is then possible to create many different solvers builded upon the same \as{} by only instantiating different modules. It is also possible to create different \comstrs{} upon the same \soset{} by using \commopers{} that \posl{} provides.

In the next chapter, a detailed study of various communicating and non-communicating strategies is presented using some \CSPs{} as benchmarks. %In this study, is showed the efficacy of \posl{} to analyze quickly and easily these strategies.
